Receive tips and feedbacks, keep track of how productive you feel and enjoy a visual representation of your daily schedule. Productivity+ can do it all!


Productivity+ currently has 2 pages, a main page on which the user's activity is recorded throughout the day, and a Set Schedule page, where users can input planned activities for the upcoming day. There is a menu bar on top of the window that allows the users to navigate between pages and provides instruction to new users. Users can choose to exit the app anytime be selecting exit from the menu bar.
