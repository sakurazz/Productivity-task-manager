# Productivity+: A New Kind of Task Manager
### By Andrew Biehl, Eva Grench, Calypso Leonard, and Yingying Wang


//A README.txt file. The file should briefly describe what the program is/does and how it works. If it's a game, the README should include brief rules of play---at least enough to get me started. It should clearly indicate which class file contains the executable. Finally, if there are any known bugs or issues with the code, these should be indicated here as well.


Productivity+ is your new go-to daily schedule manager. Combining the visuals of a calendar app with the check-box functionality of a normal task manager, you can now track everything you do during your day, from brushing your teeth to working out.

//maybe delete this part?
Imagine how awkward it would feel to quarter off time to "eat breakfast" every day on your calendar app, or set a reminder to "sleep" on your task manager. Well now you have a place to do those things! Set your daily schedule goals and compare your real-time activities side-by-side. Receive tips and feedbacks, keep track of how productive you feel and enjoy a visual representation of your daily schedule. Productivity+ can do it all!


Productivity+ currently has 2 pages, a main page on which the user's activity is recorded throughout the day, and a Set Schedule page, where users can input planned activities for the upcoming day. There is a menu bar on top of the window that allows the users to navigate between pages and provides instruction to new users.(insert stuff about productivity) Users can choose to exit the app anytime be selecting exit from the menu bar. 

Productivity+ is a work in progress and we would love to implement
